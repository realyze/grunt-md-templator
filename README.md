# grunt-markdown-processor

1. Write a Markdown file with your content.
2. Write a lo-dash (Grunt) template that describes the resulting HTML.
3. Let this plugin generate the HTML files for you.

### What is that good for?
Consider you have a number of similar pages you want to author content for. And you
prefer writing them in Markdown and/or you're not an HTML person.

We got you covered.

Take this plugin and let some HTML savvy gal or guy write the code for you.
Then run it through this plugin and it will generate tasty fresh HTML for ya!

## Getting Started
This plugin requires Grunt `~0.4.1`

If you haven't used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide, as it explains how to create a [Gruntfile](http://gruntjs.com/sample-gruntfile) as well as install and use Grunt plugins. Once you're familiar with that process, you may install this plugin with this command:

```shell
npm install grunt-markdown-jade --save-dev
```

Once the plugin has been installed, it may be enabled inside your Gruntfile with this line of JavaScript:

```js
grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-markdown-jade');
```

## The "markdown_jade" task
