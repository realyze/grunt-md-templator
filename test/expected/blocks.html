    <section id="web-apps">
        <p>This is my rant about Web Apps which is not in any block because the 2nd level header ended the block above (because it was a level-2-heading block).</p>

        <p>Now here is some markdown just for fun:
            <em> with bullet points
 </em> oh yes! * with many bullet points!!!</p>



        <div class="I-am-the-front-block">
            <h3>Block 2.1 header</h3>

            <p>This header and content is contained in the <code>front</code> block.</p>

            <p>Yet another paragraph.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="I-am-the-second-block">
            <h3>Block 2.2 header</h3>

            <p>This header and content is contained in the <code>back</code> block.</p>
