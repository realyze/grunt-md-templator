# Solutions

This is the Solutions noodle.

## Overview

some overview

--- front ---

This is block 1 of the Solutions noodle.

### Header 3
some 3rd level content within the `front` block

--- back ---

This is block 2 of the Solutions noodle and it lies within the `back` block.

## Web Apps

This is my rant about Web Apps which is not in any block because the 2nd level
header ended the block above (because it was a level-2-heading block).

Now here is some markdown just for fun:
 * with bullet points
 * oh yes!
 * with many bullet points!!!

--- front ---

### Block 2.1 header
This header and content is contained in the `front` block.

Yet another paragraph.

--- back ---

### Block 2.2 header
This header and content is contained in the `back` block.

## Last 2nd level header
...which is not contained in any block.
